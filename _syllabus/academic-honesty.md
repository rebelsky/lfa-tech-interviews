summary: Some basic guidlines regarding academic honesty, particularly as it applies in our class.

# {{ page.title }}

The academic endeavor caries with it a notion that academics (students,
faculty, researchers, staff) must follow high standards of honesty in
their academic work. One component of academic honesty is that academics
must clearly indicate which work (ideas, writing, etc.) is theirs and
which belongs to others.

To many people, the focus of academic honesty is plagiarism and the
purpose of academic honesty is integrity. For example, Grinnell's
student handbook once included the following statement:

> The college expects Grinnell students to demonstrate a high code of
> personal honor in all their relationships. Further, the college seeks
> to protect the integrity of the operations in which grades are
> involved: the granting of degrees, the conferring of honors and
> privileges, and the certification and transfer of credits to other
> institutions. Accordingly, students who are dishonest in the
> preparation of assignments or in examinations may incur the penalty of
> probation, immediate failure in the course, suspension, or dismissal
> from the college.
>
> Dishonesty in academic work often involves plagiarism. A student is
> expect to acknowledge explicitly any expressions, ideas, or
> observations that are not his or her own. In submitting a report,
> paper, examination, homework assignment, or computer program, he or
> she is stating that the form and content of the paper, report,
> examination, homework assignment, or computer program represents his
> or her own work, except where clear and specific reference is made to
> other sources. Even when there may be no conscious effort to deceive,
> failure to make appropriate acknowledgment may constitute plagiarism.
> Therefore, students should comply with \[appropriate requirements for
> acknowledging sources\]. (Grinnell College 2000-2001 Student Handbook,
> p. 51)

However, plagiarism is not the only kind of academic dishonesty that can
happen; there is much more to academic honesty than just making sure to
cite work you've used. In particular, you are expected to provide a
true and accurate representation of your work in experimental endeavors
(e.g., it is academically dishonest to invent or modify experimental
results). It is also academically dishonest to aid another in an
academically dishonest act (e.g., to provide aid on a no-aid exam, to
write a paper for another student).

There are also more reasons to care about academic honesty than simply
"the integrity of operations". First, academic advancement requires that
a trail of ideas be available so that successes and failures can be
traced backward. Second, your own personal integrity requires that you
be academically honest.

Note that most of the faculty (and, we hope, the students) at
Grinnell feel the same way. You will note that the College pamphlet,
[*Academic Honesty: Scholarly Integrity, Collaboration, and the
Ethical Use of
Sources*](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/AcadProg/Academic_Honesty_Booklet.pdf)
provides this much broader view, particularly as compared to the
2000-2001 handbook.

About this document
-------------------

I wrote this document in response to a number of factors. First, I had
already been required to write such a document in my previous teaching
position. Second, I was unhappy about the focus of Grinnell's academic
honesty statement. Third, I had my own experience with academic
dishonesty at Grinnell (although it took a few years to get to that
stage).

The *Academic Honesty* pamphlet makes this statement slightly less
necessary. However, I continue to distribute it because I want to
emphasize my concern for these matters, because the pamphlet suggests
that faculty members make their policies clear, and because, well, I
hate to throw anything away.

Expectations
------------

I expect you to follow the highest principles of academic honesty. Among
other things, this means that any work you turn in should be your own or
should have the work of others clearly documented. However, when you
explicitly work as part of a group or team, you need not identify the
work of each individual (unless I specify otherwise).

You should never "give away" answers to homework assignments or
examinations. You may, however, work together in developing answers to
most homework assignments. Except as specified on individual
assignments, each student should develop his or her own final version of
the assignment. On written assignments, each student should write up an
individual version of the assignment and cite the discussion. On
non-group programming assignments, each student should do his or her own
programming, although students may help each other with design and
debugging.

If you have a question as to whether a particular action may violate
academic standards, please discuss it with me (preferably before you
undertake that action).

Collaborative work
------------------

Most of my teaching involves *collaborative work*. I believe (and have
found) that students learn better when they can consult with each other.
For example, there are few better ways to learn something than to
explain that thing to someone else.

In each assignment I give, I do my best to make it clear whether the
assignment is intended to be primarily collaborative or primarily
individual.

What about discussions?
-----------------------

As you have no doubt noted in your own writing, the ideas you write
about come from a variety of sources. Certainly, some are your own.
Others clearly derive from the works you read. Some are part of common
intellectual currency. However, as you begin to participate in
communities of scholars, such as the community that is your Tutorial,
you will find that you garner many ideas from the formal and informal
conversations in those communities.

What responsibility do you have to cite discussions, presentations, and
other forms of oral communication? Unfortunately, there seems to be no
standard practice. Some suggest that you should always err on the side
of care, and do your best to cite every idea you get from elsewhere,
even if it comes in a discussion. Others suggest that the ideas that
come from a discussion are effectively part of a common or implicit
intellectual repository and therefore need no citation. Still others
take a middle ground and suggest that a less formal citation, such as an
acknowledgements section, such as a note that "Many of the ideas in this
paper were developed in discussions with the members of *some class*".
And, admittedly, others don't even think about this issue.

As a student, you have a responsibility for determining your
instructor's perspective on this issue (and on other issues of
citation). You should make such a determination early, particularly
since in classes in which you must cite discussion, you will need
precise notes so that you know when and by whom particular ideas were
raised.

I consider the ideas raised in class and informal discussions to
be common resources for the class, and do not requite formal citation.
However, I do recommend that you include an *acknowledgements*
section in your paper and that you highlight particular support in
that section.

Citing Web pages
----------------

The advances of the Internet and the World Wide Web have led to
challenges in citation. Some seem to believe that it is acceptable for a
citation to consist of a URL. However, a citation should provide much
more information. Consider what a typical citation to the printed
literature contains: Author, Date, Title of Article, Publisher, etc.
Your Web citations should contain at least as much detail. That is, you
must include not just the URL, but also the author of the page (using
"Anonymous" or an institutional author, if necessary), the title of the
page, the publisher (the site), and the date.

The date is particularly important. Unlike printed sources, which have
new editions when they change, electronic resources often change
unexpectedly. By including the date the page was accessed and modified,
you at least provide some indication of when the ideas you were using
were available at the specified location.

Here is a sample citation for this page, using a slight variant of the
APA form.

Note that since Web pages change, you may find it useful to keep a copy
of any Web page that you plan to cite. In the past, I've found
[Zotero](http://www.zotero.org) to be a particularly useful tool for
these purposes. Zotero can also be helpful in making bibliographies.
