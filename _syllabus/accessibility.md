# {{ page.title }}

As I note in [my statement on accommodations and
adjustments](../handouts/accommodations), I do what I can to accommodate
students who need different kinds of support.  In part, I do so by trying
to keep my Web pages accessible.  (I include a link to WAVE on the bottom
of each page to as way to remind myself to check; I don't remember as much
as I'd like.)

Like the broader Grinnell College community, I am committed to providing
a site that a broad audience can access, regardless of technology
or ability.  The College provides a [more detailed statement about these
issues](https://www.grinnell.edu/web-accessibility) as well as a 
longer [digital accessibility policy](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-01/Digital%20Accessibility%20Policy%208-1-2018.pdf).

If you would like additional assistance or have
accessibility concerns about College Web sites, please contact the [Office of
Communications](mailto:communications@grinnell.edu) at 641-269-3400.
If you need general accommodations, please contact [our office of
Disability Resources](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/accessibility-disability/disability-services).
If you have particular concerns about my site, please contact me 
at [rebelsky@grinnell.edu](mailto:rebelsky@grinnell.edu?subject=Accessibility Issue With Web Site).
