- topic: Brainstorming approaches
  abbrev: brainstorming
  summary: |
     To create an algorithm, you will often need to "brainstorm" the various ways you might approach the design of algorithms.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: Alex Mitchell '17"
    - How do you solve problems?
  notes: ../eboards/eboard07

- topic: From algorithm to code
  abbrev: coding
  summary: |
    We consider the steps you might take as you move from your initial algorithm to an implementation of it in a programming language.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: Cassie Koomjian"
    - Choosing a language
    - Language features you should know cold

- topic: Language features and other reasons to ask questions
  abbrev: questions
  summary: |
    We revisit how much you need to know a programming language in the context of another important non-technical skill: asking questions.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: TBD"
    - Looking up language features
    - Asking questions about language features
    - Asking questions about design and approach
    - Other kinds of questions

- topic: Asymptotic analysis
  abbrev: big-o
  summary: |
    We consider strategies for analyzing the asymptotic running time of algorithms.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: Kay Spassaro"
    - Common running times
    - Issues to remember

- topic: Getting unstuck
  abbrev: unstuck
  summary: |
    We consider what to do when you're "stuck" in designing an algorithm, translating the algorithm, finding errors, and such.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: TBD"
    - Tips and techniques
    - Staying calm

- topic: Practicing with HackerRank and other systems
  abbrev: practice
  summary: |
    We consider the value of using systems like HackerRank to build our skill in software development and technical interviews

    - "Visitor: Lea Marolt Sonnenschein"
    - HackerRank and similar systems
    - Preparing reusable libraries and templates

- topic: System design interviews
  abbrev: system-design
  summary: |
    We start to conclude the course by considering a different kind of technical interview, one that considers higher-level system design issues.
  subjects:
    - "Visitor: TBD"
    - About system design interviews

- topic: Wrapup, evaluate, and debrief
  abbrev: wrapup
