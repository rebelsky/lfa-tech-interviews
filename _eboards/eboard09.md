  interviews and some other things.

About preregistration
---------------------

### Some numbers

We have about 

* 60 majors in the class of 2024, 
* 80 majors in the class of 2025, and 
* 50 students in the two sections of CSC-207 this semester (most of whom are likely CS majors). 

That's approximately 190 people who might need seats in 200- and 300-level 
CS classes in the spring. 

* Some people (seniors) need two classes. 
* We have some mid-year graduates.
* Some me third-years are studying abroad. 
* Some of the 207 students are third-years. 

I think the numbers balance out. Maybe that's 180 people who need seats.

Our spring offerings (after hiring two two-course visitors)

* CSC-211 (24), 
* CSC-301 (2 x 20), 
* CSC-324 (2 x 20), 
* CSC-341 (2 x 20), and 
* CSC-395 (2 x 20). 

That gives 184 seats. 

So things are tight.  If things work out, everyone will get one upper-level
CS course (except for a few seniors who need two courses, who will get two).

It sounds like one of the sections of CSC-395 won't be approved
before rounds 1/2.  That means that some people who try to register
for an upper-level CS class will be closed out.

I don't know how we're handling the second section of CSC-395.

"Don't blame me, I'm only the messenger."

### Questions

Peer interview time
-------------------

Everyone has a card.  If you have a red card, grab a red sheet.  If
you have a black card, grab a black sheet.

Spend five minutes reading your sheet so that you know the questions
that you will be asking.

Find your card partner.

Spend black will spend twenty minutes interviewing red.

Red will spend twenty minutes interviewing black.

We will debrief afterwards.
