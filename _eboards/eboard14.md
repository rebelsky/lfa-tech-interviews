Debrief on the course
---------------------

_I don't think one-credit courses should have EOCEs._

The course did not go the way I had hoped. In part, my grand design of
combining alums and interview prep was a bit too ambitious. In part, I'm
functioning at much less than normal capacity and could not keep it
organized. (I'm never good at organization; I was significantly worse
than normal.)

When I next have the chance to offer a one-credit, career-related course
do you think I should focus on interview prep or the alumni talks? Why?

* Interview prep
* Alumni talks
