About the class
---------------

* Course site: <https://rebelsky.cs.grinnell.edu/Courses/CSC281/2023Fa>.
* Three primary goals
    * Introduce you to possible career paths via alumni
    * Develop skills to help you succeed
    * New this semester: Practice with tech interviews
* Disclaimer: The standard model of tech interviews is inequitable and
  does not really test for the things people think it does.
* Rationale
    *
    *
* Class model
    * Weekly visits by alumni (and a few others)
    * Alumni will also do recorded practice tech interviews with a
      few students.  Others will watch/skim them.
    * Others will also conduct their own interviews.
    * We will debrief each week.  What went well / went less well /
      what did we learn?
    * Alumni will also give short descriptions of their career paths,
      their normal workdays, and such.  Plus answer questions.
* If you do the regular work and show up to class, you get an S.
* If you don't, you get an F.

Visit by Anthony Mays
---------------------

* A leader/founder of Brilliant Black Minds.
* Regularly trains people on technical interviews.
* I met him in a course designed to encourage faculty to include
  tech interview training in their courses.
* If all goes well, I'll figure out the technology to get him to class.
  I think we agreed upon Teams.
