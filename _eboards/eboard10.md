### Questions

Alumni biographical talk
------------------------

* Feel free to ask questions as we go.

Before Grinnell

* First gen student.  Only child.

  MySpace (10 years old or so).
* Took AP CS in high school.

At Grinnell

* Thought they would be a biochem major.
* Didn't get into intro Bio.  Took CS instead.
* CS was hard.  Chem was hard.
* Didn't stick with a CS major b/c didn't want to get B's.
    * No one has every looked at their grades.  Or almost no one.
* Ended up choosing a philosophy major.
    * "I can teach myself CS.  I can't work with great minds in philosophy
       outside of Grinnell (or not so easily)."
* Studied abroad in Rwanda.  (Peace and Justice.)
* Did an externship (nonprofit), taught in Grinnell Prison Programming.
* Graded for CS.  Slow.  Sent out grades at 2am (sends a bad message to
  students).

Post college, phase 1

* Did Americorps after college.  Did not do well and quit early.
* Use Web skills to get job at Dice.  (Gamble with your employment?)
* Worked with wordpress.
* Eventually outgrew the position.  IMPORTANT: It's okay to switch jobs;
  realize that you don't have to do everything.
* Started Georgia Tech online masters.  Realized that it wasn't worthwhle
  for them.  IMPORTANT: Think about why you want to get more degrees.
* Online work for company in Portland.  Pay was lowish.
* Started at small financial startup.  Didn't pay attention to red flags.
  IMPORTANT: If everyone is a junior engineer, there's no one to learn from.
* Next: A consultant.  Got placed at HyVee.
* Next: Pioneer.  Worked on digital agriculture.  (Using sattelite imagry
  to assess crop health.)

Post college, phase 2

* Hired by Target.  Target paid to move her to MSP.
* Ended up working on Target cloud team.  Not enough Dev.
* Then on to network engineering.  Ended up becoming a project lead.
  Set up API standrds, etc.  Did the role above them.
* Downside of working for a company: Ready for promotion, but no
  promotions avalable/permitted.
* Invited to apply to WoTC.
* Working on background at WoTC.
* WoTC is a print company, but need to work in the digital world, too.
* Working on an API.

Detour: APIs

* "Application Programming Interface"
* A program that talks to data (e.g., in database) and sends back
  information based on particular requests.
* Sometimes returns the data in JSON format.
* Might also provide secrets and such.

What is a work day in operations?

* Things break and then you go fix them.  (Some people love this; others
  prefer to write things.)

What is a work day as a network programmer?

* 

What is a work day as a program lead?

* Writing
* Meetings
* Convincing others of things.

What is a work day as [whatever your are at WoTC]?

* Working from home.
* 6:30 - 3:30.

What is a good work-life balance?

* Saying "I'm done" after 8--9 hours of work each day.  (Even though they
  are starting at 4:30 am west coast time, they stop at 1:30 pm west coast
  time each day.)
* It can be hard to convince others that work-from-home is equivalent to
  in-offce work.

How did you move into a new role?

* Read O'Reilly books on the concepts you need for work.
* Ask lots of questions.  It ends up beng an assset.
* The more your work, the more natural things become.

* Not how we normally think about the data.

Have you sold out?

* Used to enjoy the Des Moines hack-a-thons.
* As an adult, needs a more reliable income.
* would build web sites but it]'s not in their best interest;
  somewone will have to monitor it.

Writing vs. Researching vs. Drawing vs. Meeting vs. Coding

> About half/half writing/research/drawing vs. coding.

> OMG.  So many meetings.  Not much happens at most meetings.  But
  some are necessary: E.g., gathering requirements, setting up
  timelines.

How did you find your jobs?

> First job: Head hunter/search firm/head-hunting firm.  

> Note there are advatages to having multiple firms bidding on you.

> Networking (e.g., at conference)

> Networking also helps with finding ou what a compny is like.
  Recommended.

How do you prepare for interviews?

> Made resume.  Had friend read over it.  (A non-technical friend
  is also a good thing.)

> Went over sample question

> Come up with answers to standard questions, such as 
>    * "How do you teach yourself a new technoloy?"
>    * "Tell me about an unsuccessful team experience and how you dealt
       with it."

> Ask good questions of the people you meet with.
>    * "What is your favorite part of working at this company?"
>    * "What are the challenges of your job?"

> Some jobs don't ask you the scary technical questions.

> "I just import the right package in Python."

Alumni general talk: What I wish I'd known
------------------------------------------

* "Click to add title."

Interview tips

* Behavioral Interview Tips
    * Know your interviewers - If you get names in advance, look them
      up on LinkedIn.  Identify things in common, ways to talk about them.
    * Look up the company - Find out the company values; someone will
      be tasked to find out whether you meet the company values.
* Three types of technical interviews
    * Take-home assignment followed by a "walk through the code"
    * Whiteboarding interviews; syntax is less important
    * Pair programming interview; sit and program in real time
* State assumptions clearly (or ask about them)
    * "I assume we're working with US currency.  Is that okay?"
    * Call out edge cases.  "Be careful!  You might cut yourself on that edge."
    * Talk about future/related work.  "With more time, I would have ..."
    * Keep talking.  They want to hear someone think aloud.  Articulate
      what you're doing.
* Enthusiasm can help.  Bring yourself to the interview.
* Make eye contact.

Kinds of jobs:

* Contractor: Usually has a fixed-term contract.  No benefits, but more money.
    * Less job security; easier for companies to let go.
* Full-time normal employee.  Gets 401K, matching, medical, other benefits.
    * They've invested in you, so they are less likely to let you go.
* Consultant vs. (Independent) Contractor:
    * In one model, you are hired by a firm (and get benefits) and then
      they sell your time to others.
    * In the other model, they connect you to the firm, the firm pays
      you, and they get a fee for making the connection.
    * Or not.

Whiteboard questions

* Higher-level design questions.  How would you design this API?
* What's the logic/protocol for one elevator?  For multiple elevators?
  How would you assess the success of your solution?
* Logic qustions.
* [Not usually algorithms.]

Promotion tips

* Be active.  Talk to your manager.  Make it clear that you want to move
  up in the organization.  Make your goals known.
* State your goals.
* Ask questions.
* Check in.
* Visibility.  Make sure that people know who you are (and have a good
  impression with you).
    * Typical promotion decision process: All the managers get in a room
      and decide which K of the N people up for promotion get a promotion.
      It helps of people know you.
* Annual reviews.  Make sure that you know the expectations for your
  position as well as the expectations for the position above you; show
  how you are fulfilling the position you are trying to get.

How did you find internships?

* Looked for REUs. (Research Experiences for Undergraduates.)
* Connections helped: Applied for an REU, they recommended that they 
  apply for another program.

What should you do about mental-health issues?

* Tell people about your anxiety.
* Take mental health days.
* Make sure that you are awesome enough that people accept those things.
  (This may depend on the company you are at.  Find the right company.)
    * A good boss will want you to succeed.
* Take care of your health.

Networking

* Networks are good; Networks can be supportive.
* Networks are mutual; you may be getting something from someone, but
  they are likely getting something from you.
* Networking helps the company in that it helps you do better.
* How do you build a network?  
    * Reach out to Grinnell alumni.
    * Facebook groups can be awesome (including Grinnell-specific ones)
        * GrinNetworking
        * Grinnell mental health
        * Everyday class notes

Other notes

* Keep a mock resume recording everything you've ever done. 
* Don't burn bridges.
* Keep records.

Should I get certificates?

* Maybe
* AWS certificates used to help; they may still
* SamR's amazing serucity course, probably not, especially since
  security is misspelled.

The elevator question ...

* What is the input?  (Our subject chose "desired floor"; I'd care more
  about "up" or "down" button outside the elevator as well as the
  Firefighters' button.)
