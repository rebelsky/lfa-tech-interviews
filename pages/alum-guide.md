# Guide for Visiting Alumni

**_Disclaimer_**: This guide may evolve over the course of the semester

Dear Alums,

**Thank you** for agreeing to visit our Learning from CS Alumni class.  This page should provide you with some of the information you need for the class.  You should also review the [course syllabus](syllabus) for further information.

**Apologies**, in advance, for being disorganized and behind.  If you know me, you probably accept those characteristics as something you expect of me.

Okay, on to the responsibilities.

I will typically ask you to do four things for a class that you visit:

* Conduct recorded technical interviews with two current students via some platform of your choice.  I can provide the technical interview questions or you can.  I'd prefer that you do those by the Saturday before your class visit so that there's time for the other students in the class can view them.
* Give a fifteen minute talk about yourself.  Students are generally interested to hear what your workday (or work-week) is like, what you did at Grinnell, and how you got from Grinnell to where you are.
* Answer questions from the students after your talk.  You can also ask questions of the students.
* Participate in a critique of the technical interviews you conducted.  I'll generally ask students to respond first before letting you provide your own critiques.

When we have remote visitors, I'll generally have two visitors per class.  When we have in-person visitors, I'll generally have one visitor per class.
